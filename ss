Create mapping table for SU code and entity relation: Design and create a mapping table, named SU_ENTITY_MAPPING, that associates SU codes with their corresponding entity relations. This table will be used during the migration process for data transformation.

Create mapping table for BCE_ACCOUNT Number with Line_item: Create another mapping table, named BCE_ACC_LINE_ITEM_MAPPING, which links BCE account numbers with their respective line items. This table will facilitate data transformation and mapping in the migration process.

Load raw feed file into race_raw_feed_data table: Using SQL loader, import the raw feed file containing the data to be migrated into a newly created database table called race_raw_feed_data. This table will serve as a staging area for the incoming data.

Add index and extract relevant data into race_bce_extract_data table: Enhance performance by adding necessary indexes or performing SMO (System Management Object) operations on the database. Then, extract BCE account numbers, SU codes (by using substring 1,5), and amounts from the race_raw_feed_data table using database functions. Store this extracted data into a separate table named race_bce_extract_data.

Create a function for data transformation and loading: Develop a function that performs the required data transformations from the race_bce_extract_data table. Utilize the mappings from SU_ENTITY_MAPPING and BCE_ACC_LINE_ITEM_MAPPING tables to associate SU codes with entity relations and BCE account numbers with line items. Load the transformed data into the race_entity_axiom_load table.

Load data into SQL using SQL loader: Finally, load the data from the race_entity_axiom_load table into the desired SQL database. Utilize the SQL loader action within the data source configuration of ds_race_data_staging to accomplish this step.
