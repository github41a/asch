Great, let's structure the "How I Did It" and "What Are the Benefits" sections into a point-wise format:

**How I Did It (Methodology):**

1. **Validating Method Selection (MD5 vs. SHA256):**
   - Faced the challenge of choosing between MD5 and SHA256 for hashing.
   - Devoted extensive time and resources to determine the optimal hashing method.
   - Conducted thorough analysis, considering all potential scenarios for hash generation.
   - Ensured accuracy and reliability of hashing reports.

**What Are the Benefits (Outcomes):**

1. **Efficient File Comparison:**
   - The utility provides an efficient and reliable method for comparing files in two servers using SHA-256 hash codes.

2. **Integrity and Consistency:**
   - By comparing hash codes for each file in both directories, the script ensures the integrity and consistency of files across the servers.

3. **Clear and Organized Reports:**
   - The script produces clear and organized report files, highlighting duplicate files, blank files, and files present in only one of the servers.

4. **Improved Efficiency and Accuracy:**
   - This tool significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of file validation and management processes on Unix servers.

5. **Reliable File Management:**
   - Organizations can use this script to ensure the reliability and consistency of their file management processes.

This format presents the methodology and benefits in a clear, point-wise manner.
