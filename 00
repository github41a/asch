5. **Community Involvement:** I engage in community service through the "Helping Hands" program with the Maher Foundation, as well as tree plantation initiatives, fostering a sense of social responsibility and inclusivity.

**How (Inclusive and Equitable Behavior):**

In each of the tasks mentioned above, I actively demonstrate inclusive and equitable behaviors by:
- Encouraging open communication and collaboration among team members from diverse backgrounds.
- Acknowledging and respecting individual differences, recognizing their value in achieving our shared goals.
- Providing support and mentorship to colleagues, ensuring everyone has an opportunity to contribute to the best of their abilities.
